# 👋 Hey there, I'm Prasath!

Welcome to my GitHub space — where code meets creativity, and crazy ideas turn into real-world tech!

I'm Prasath, a curious developer and builder with a passion for smart systems, real-time automation, and IoT innovation. Whether it’s making gas sensors talk to the internet 🌐 or turning cow dung into data 💨, I love experimenting with meaningful tech.

Currently exploring the worlds of **IoT**, **web development**, and **automation**, I enjoy creating projects that combine hardware and software — from tiny microcontrollers to interactive web apps.

This GitHub is a living lab of my tech journey — filled with experiments, mini marvels, and ideas in progress. Some are polished. Some are chaotic. All are *me*.
